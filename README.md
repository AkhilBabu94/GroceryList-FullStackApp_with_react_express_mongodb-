It is a full-featured web application which uses React.js to build a front-end web application, and uses Browserify and Gulp to load the app isomorphically in Node.js. It also uses Express for handling HTTP requests and integrates Mongoose with Express for fast data storage.

It shows us the purchased grocery items which can be added or deleted in lightning fast speed from db. In this app you can buy and unbuy items and this persists to the server. You can delete items and add new items to the list.
